### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jake!

I'm a Senior at the University of Pennsylvania, studying Biochemistry and Computer Science. Feel free to look through some of the random things I've created :)

I'm interested in using computational tools to solve biological problems. I'm also interested in WebDev! Feel free to look through some of the hobby websites I've created.
