### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jake!

I'm a recent graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, having received my BA in Biochemistry and Computer Science and my MSc in Chemistry. I want to make the world a better place using code. Towards this goal, I have used computational tools to solve biological problems, and WebDev! I'm excited to see what oppurtunities the future holds. Feel free to look through some of the projects I've worked on.
