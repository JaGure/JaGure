### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jake!

I'm a recent graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, having received my BA in Biochemistry and Computer Science and my MSc in Chemistry. I want to make the world a better place using code. Historically, I've been interested in using computational tools to solve biological problems, and in WebDev! Feel free to look through some of the projects I've worked on.
